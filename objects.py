#In Python, an instance is a specific object created from a class.
#A class is like a blueprint (for example, Dog).
#An instance is a real object made from that blueprint (for example, my_dog = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever")).
#So, my_dog is an instance of the Dog class.
#You can create many instances (objects) from the same class, each with its own data.
